# Q2Pipe
Q2Pipe is a Qiime2 based pipeline designed to facilitate and standardise ecological studies by metabarcoding using Illumina Miseq data. It basically shell scripts calling different Qiime2 commands and Q2Pipe dependencies (https://github.com/Patg13/Q2Pipe_Deps) to produce the results. Q2Pipe was also designed to minimized the installation work and maximise the compatiblity between different systems.

# Setup

Q2Pipe can be used with the Qiime2's anaconda environment but was designed to work with a Singularity image container (which is based on the Qiime2's Docker release) and therefore is the recommended method for this pipeline.

## Building the singularity image yourself
**Make sure Singularity is installed and ready on your system before building the image**

## Pulling the image from the Singularity repo
NOT AVAILABLE FOR NOW, IMAGE STILL NOT ON REPO

This pipeline was developped at Natural Ressources Canada's Dr. Christine Martineau laboratory
